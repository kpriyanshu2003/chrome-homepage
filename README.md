# chrome-homepage

This is a chrome extension that tends to change the default homepage of the browser to this one. This extension is created using basic HTML, CSS and JS. 

I hope to create this using react-js in later future. 

You can checkout how the extension looks using the url provided in the description. If you are not able to find it there click [here](https://kpriyanshu2003.github.io/chrome-homepage)
